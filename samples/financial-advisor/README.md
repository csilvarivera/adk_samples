# Financial Advisor


## Overview

The Financial Advisor is a team of specialized AI agents that assists human financial advisors.

1. Data Analyst Agent: This agent is responsible for creating in-depth and current market analysis reports for specific stock tickers. It achieves this by repeatedly using Google Search to find a predetermined amount of unique, recent (within a given timeframe), and insightful information. The agent focuses on gathering both SEC filings and broader market intelligence via Google Search tool, which it then uses to compile a structured report based solely on the collected data.

2. Trading Analyst Agent: This agent's task is to develop and describe at least five different trading strategies. It does this by carefully reviewing the comprehensive market analysis provided by the Data Analyst Agent. Each proposed strategy must be customized to match the user's declared risk tolerance and intended investment duration.

3. Execution Agent: This agent creates a thorough and well-justified plan for implementing a given trading strategy. The plan must be carefully adjusted to fit the user's risk tolerance, investment timeframe, and preferred methods of execution. The output will be detailed and fact-based, examining the best approaches and specific timing for initiating, maintaining, adding to, partially selling, and completely exiting investment positions.

4. Risk Evaluation Agent: This agent's role is to produce a detailed and reasoned analysis of the risks associated with a specific trading strategy and its execution plan. This analysis needs to be precisely aligned with the user's stated risk tolerance, investment period, and execution preferences. The output will be rich in factual analysis, clearly outlining all identified risks and suggesting concrete, actionable steps to lessen their impact.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
   
    ```

1.  **Create a virtual environment**

    ```
    python3.11 -m venv .venv
    ```

    This command assumes you have python 3.11 installed in your system

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    This activates the virtual environment, allowing you to run commands within the project's environment.
    Make sure the environment is active.

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


### Alternative: Install with uv (Recommended)
You can also use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for faster installation:

1. Install uv:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or if you have a pyproject.toml
   # uv pip install .
   ```
5.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    Rename the file ".env-example" to ".env"
    Fill the below values:

    ```bash
    # Choose Model Backend: 0 -> ML Dev, 1 -> Vertex
    GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1

    # ML Dev backend config. Fill if using Ml Dev backend.
    GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'

    # Vertex backend config
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'

    # Agent Engine backend config - bucket for agent engine
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'

    # BigQuery config
    BIGQUERY_DATASET='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'
    BIGQUERY_PROJECT='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'
    BIGQUERY_TABLE='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'
    ```
6.  **Execute the developer environment:**

    ```
    adk web
    
    ```

7.  **Deploy to Agent engine:**

    From the root project execute 
    ```
    python -m deploy
    
    ```
    Make sure your environment variables are set. For now, the deploy.py is pointing to always create a new Agent Engine. However, you can modify the ```main``` method to either list Agent Engines or test it locally.
    TODO: Add the ability to add flags for testing 

8.  **Deploy to Agentspace:**

    Modify the environment variables in the deploy_as.sh bash file with your data:

    -  Gemini Enterprise app Id
    -  Reasoning Engine Id
    -  Agent Id 

    From the root project execute 
    ```
    sh deploy_as.sh
    
    ```
    IMPORTANT: Your prpoject needs to be allowlisted for this command to work. This functionality is still in private preview and should be use for demo purposes only
